# AI-Enhanced-CTF-Training



## Abstract
The dynamic nature of cyber threats necessitates advanced training methodologies in the field of cybersecurity. This study aims to improve Capture the Flag (CTF) events, which are essential for cybersecurity training, by integrating them with the 'secureBERT' NLP model and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The objective is to provide cybersecurity analysts with a more user-friendly and effective tool for understanding and categorizing cyber threats. The findings demonstrate that integrating cybersecurity challenges and objectives significantly enhances comprehension, thereby aligning training more closely with real-world scenarios. This proposed system not only improves analysts' learning experiences but also ensures adherence to industry standards, which is critical in preparing them for the evolving landscape of cyber threats.

## Introduction
Our research addresses the constant cat-and-mouse game between threat actors and defenders. As cyberattacks evolve, cybersecurity analysts need better tools to understand the logic behind CTF challenges and accurately map them to real-world adversarial behavior. This research aims to develop an AI-powered system to enhance the capabilities of CTF players in identifying and understanding persistent threat actors.

### Contributions
- A novel application of natural language processing and industry-standard frameworks for CTF comprehension.
- Enhancing threat intelligence to equip defenders against emerging attacks.

## Research Question
How can we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to create an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that can help cybersecurity analysts better understand Capture the Flag challenges, enhance their skills, and improve defense against real-world threats?

## Methodology
The methodology includes searching for relevant datasets, outlining the system framework, preprocessing the data, utilizing NLP techniques like BERT to categorize challenge descriptions based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and incorporating a recommendation engine to suggest training resources. The system would be tested and validated in collaboration with cybersecurity experts.

## Conclusion
This research proposes an AI-driven method to augment CTF training for cybersecurity analysts, allowing them to safeguard key systems against sophisticated adversaries. The proposed system improves the learning experience of analysts and ensures they are well-prepared for the evolving landscape of cyber threats.
